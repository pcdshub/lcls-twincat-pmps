    <Declaration><![CDATA[FUNCTION F_eVExcludeRange : DWORD
(*
    Given an lower and upper end of an exclusion range, return the corresponding eV bitmask.

    eVs between fLower and fUpper will be considered unsafe, and eVs outside of this range will be
    considered safe, with the exception of the endpoints and values near the endpoints if they land
    far from an eV boundary.

    Call this in your init cycle to set up your eV bitmasks for more readable code
    that is also more resiliant to eV range definition adjustments.
